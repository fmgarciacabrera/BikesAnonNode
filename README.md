# Bikes Anonymous (NodeJS)

This is the starter project for the Secret Source Technology SL Bikes Anonymous (NodeJS) sample project.

This project in its current state includes:

- Express (mostly unconfigured but may have one or two routes - it's up to you to decide if they are worthy of keeping)
- Authentication scaffolding (mostly configured, we don't want you to have to bother with something so standard)
- Bugs (either typos or just plain incorrect usage of commands)
- Incorrect packages (we'll leave it up to you to figure out which ones should stay, which should go, and which should still be added)
- One or more tests of questionable value, and possibly comlpetely broken

The project may optionally include:

- WET code
- Code smells
- Unused code
- Other, myriad bad practices (which you are welcome to fix as part of this project - is that jpg really 8MB?)

And finally, we're providing this repo in JavaScript (because it has the widest audience) but if you really want to, you can convert it to TypeScript (or just do your part in TypeScript).
