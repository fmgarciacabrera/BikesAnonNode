# Bikes Anonymous (NodeJS)

This is the starter project for the Secret Source Technology SL Bikes Anonymous (NodeJS) sample project.

This project in its current state includes:

- Express (mostly unconfigured but may have one or two routes - it's up to you to decide if they are worthy of keeping)
- Authentication scaffolding (mostly configured, we don't want you to have to bother with something so standard)
- Bugs (either typos or just plain incorrect usage of commands)
- Incorrect packages (we'll leave it up to you to figure out which ones should stay, which should go, and which should still be added)
